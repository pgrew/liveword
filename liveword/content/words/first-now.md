My mindfulness practice began on a bridge in a crowded bus headed north towards the city. It was an ordinary day. Sensations of body odors, hissing brakes, flashing yellow lights, piney cannabis, and a cold seat brought me to my breath. Breathing in gave me the insight that I was alive. I surrendered the next for the then, and suddenly I found myself beside God. After sailing a ways in this new direction I turned and saw the bend in my wake.
