When reading my faded yellow legal pads, I found several poems I wrote while eating lunch. Not surprisingly, food was my most popular topic, but there were a few about God or my late dog Buster.

For months I sat on these poems with the hopes to read them at an poetry open mic after the virus passes. After being laid off in December, I gained the determination to publish the poems. Editing took a few days, and I cut a dozen or so poems down to seven. On January 30th, 2021 my first published work [Moving Meals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VHNHSMC) became available in the Kindle Store!
